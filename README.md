# üåç Global Development Data Analysis

This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a dataset containing the following development indicators:

- Population  
- Rural Population (%)  
- GDP (Gross Domestic Product)  
- Electricity Supply (%)

---

## üßπ Data Cleaning

The raw dataset required extensive preprocessing. The cleaning process included:

- Removing null values and duplicate rows
- Standardizing column names for clarity
- Converting data types (e.g., GDP to numeric)
- Handling missing values using interpolation and statistical imputation
- Normalizing percentage fields for accurate comparison

The cleaned dataset is available.

## üìä Data Analysis

We conducted various analyses to extract insights, including:

- Correlation between GDP and electricity supply
- Relationship between rural population percentage and electricity access
- Country-wise comparisons and regional trends
- Visualization.

All analysis notebooks are stored in the directory.
